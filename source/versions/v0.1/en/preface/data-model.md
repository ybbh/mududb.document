# Data Model

MuduDB exposes both SQL-style relational data access and procedure-oriented business logic. This page describes the shared data model that underlies both paths.

## Tables and primary keys

A MuduDB database contains **tables** defined through SQL DDL. Each table has:

- A table name and a logical `table_id`.
- One or more columns with a declared data type and nullability.
- A **primary key**, which may be simple or composite.

The primary key determines the physical clustering order and is used for point lookups, range scans, and partition routing.

## Indexes

Currently, the primary key is the main access path. Secondary index support is planned; until then, range scans over the primary key and direct key access are the primary query mechanisms.

## Partitioning keys

Tables can be bound to a global **partition rule**. The partition columns must form a prefix of the primary key. MuduDB uses RANGE partitioning in v0.1: each partition owns a contiguous key interval.

See [Partitioning](../internal/partitioning.md) for the rule, binding, placement, and routing model.

## Procedure input and output types

Mudu Procedures are ordinary functions that operate on MuduDB data. Their input and return types must be representable by the MuduDB datum / tuple conversion system:

- Scalar values: `i32`, `i64`, `String`, `f32`, `f64`, etc.
- Container values: `Vec<T>`, tuples, and generated `Entity` structs.

The exact supported surface is defined by the current `mudu_type` conversion and transpiler implementation.

## Schema-to-code mapping

The `mgen` tool reads `ddl.sql` and generates Rust `Entity` structs that implement the `Entity` trait. This gives typed query results and parameters:

```rust
#[derive(Entity)]
struct Account {
    id: i64,
    owner: String,
    balance: i64,
}
```

`mudu_query::<Account>(oid, sql, params)` automatically maps result rows to `Account` instances.

## Compatibility

When data model semantics change (for example, adding a new format version or changing tuple encoding), MuduDB tracks compatibility through versioned contracts. Application code and persisted data should be migrated according to the relevant contract's upgrade and rollback rules.

See the [Format and Protocol Contracts](../reference/contracts/index.md) for details.
