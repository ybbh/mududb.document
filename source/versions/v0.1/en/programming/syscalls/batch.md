# batch

Purpose

Execute multiple operations as a single batched request.

Signature

```text
batch(ops: [string | primitive-op], options?: { atomic: bool }) -> BatchResult
```

Parameters

- ops: an ordered list of concrete SQL statements or primitive operations. Parameterized SQL strings are not supported.
- options.atomic: when true, the runtime attempts to execute the batch as an atomic group (all-or-nothing). Atomic batches may be rejected depending on the storage engine.

Behavior

- Executes ops in sequence under the current session and transaction context.
- If any op fails and options.atomic is true, the runtime attempts to roll back prior ops in the batch; rollback guarantees depend on storage support.
- If parameters are provided with SQL strings, the runtime returns NotImplemented (see reference note).

Return value

- BatchResult contains per-op status entries and a summary (success count, error entries).

Errors and edge cases

- NotImplemented: when a caller supplies SQL parameter placeholders with a non-empty parameter list.
- ConstraintViolation: returned when a mutation violates schema or uniqueness constraints.
- PartialFailure: when atomic=false, some ops may succeed while others fail; check per-op status.

Transaction semantics

- Batches participate in the current transaction. If no transaction is open, behavior follows host defaults (autocommit or per-op commit).

Example

```sql
-- two concrete statements in a batch
batch([
  "INSERT INTO accounts (id, owner, balance) VALUES (3, 'Eve', 3000)",
  "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 2"
], { atomic: true });
```

Best practices

- Avoid passing parameter placeholders to batch; expand parameters before batching.
- Use atomic batches sparingly; prefer explicit transactions for complex multi-step updates.
- Prefer smaller batches to reduce lock contention and improve failure isolation.
